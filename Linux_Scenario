Here are **20 scenario-based Linux interview questions and answers** that will help you prepare for your interview:

---

### 1. **Scenario**: *You need to create a new user in Linux with a home directory and set a password. How would you do this?*

**Answer**:  
You can use the following commands:
```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash newuser  # Create a new user with home directory and default shell
sudo passwd newuser  # Set the password for the new user
```

- `-m`: Creates the home directory if it doesn't exist.
- `-s`: Specifies the login shell.

---

### 2. **Scenario**: *You have a server with 100GB disk space, and it’s running out of space. How would you find and remove unnecessary files to free up space?*

**Answer**:  
1. **Check disk usage**:
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```

2. **Find large files**:
   ```bash
   find / -type f -size +100M  # Find files larger than 100MB
   ```

3. **Check directories using du**:
   ```bash
   du -sh /*  # Shows disk usage for top-level directories
   ```

4. **Remove unnecessary files**:  
   Once identified, use the `rm` command to delete unnecessary files.

   ```bash
   rm /path/to/large/file
   ```

---

### 3. **Scenario**: *You need to change the permissions of a file so that only the owner can read and write to it, while others have no access. What command would you use?*

**Answer**:  
```bash
chmod 600 /path/to/file
```

Explanation:
- `6` allows read and write permissions for the owner.
- `0` denies all permissions for the group and others.

---

### 4. **Scenario**: *How would you check which process is using the most CPU on a Linux system?*

**Answer**:  
You can use the `top` or `htop` command:

```bash
top
```

Or, if `htop` is installed:

```bash
htop
```

In the output, the process using the most CPU will be listed at the top.

---

### 5. **Scenario**: *How would you monitor real-time system logs for troubleshooting?*

**Answer**:  
Use the `tail` command with `-f` option:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/syslog
```

This will display new log entries as they are added in real-time.

---

### 6. **Scenario**: *You need to configure a system to automatically mount an external drive at boot. How do you do this?*

**Answer**:  
1. **Find the device name**:
   ```bash
   sudo lsblk
   ```

2. **Edit the `/etc/fstab` file** to add an entry for the drive:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/fstab
   ```

   Add a line similar to:
   ```
   /dev/sdb1  /mnt/external  ext4  defaults  0  2
   ```

3. **Mount the drive**:
   ```bash
   sudo mount -a  # Mounts all filesystems mentioned in fstab
   ```

---

### 7. **Scenario**: *A user reports that they cannot access a shared directory. How would you troubleshoot?*

**Answer**:
1. **Check directory permissions**:
   ```bash
   ls -ld /path/to/directory
   ```

2. **Check user permissions** (if group-based):
   ```bash
   groups username
   ```

3. **Check for file system issues**:
   ```bash
   dmesg | grep error
   ```

4. **Check for ACL issues** (if ACL is in use):
   ```bash
   getfacl /path/to/directory
   ```

5. **Check network access** (if shared via NFS/Samba):
   - For NFS: Check `/etc/exports`.
   - For Samba: Check `/etc/samba/smb.conf`.

---

### 8. **Scenario**: *You accidentally deleted a critical file and need to recover it. What would you do?*

**Answer**:
1. **Check if it’s in the trash** (for GUI environments).
2. **Check the `~/.bash_history` file** for recent commands if the file was recently modified.
3. **Check backups** (if regular backups are in place).
4. **Try using extundelete** (for ext3/ext4 filesystems):
   ```bash
   sudo extundelete /dev/sdX --restore-file /path/to/file
   ```

---

### 9. **Scenario**: *You need to find all files modified in the last 7 days. How would you do this?*

**Answer**:
```bash
find /path/to/search -type f -mtime -7
```

Explanation:
- `-mtime -7`: Files modified in the last 7 days.

---

### 10. **Scenario**: *You need to configure a cron job that runs a script every day at 3 AM. How would you do this?*

**Answer**:
1. **Edit the cron table**:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. **Add the cron job**:
   ```bash
   0 3 * * * /path/to/script.sh
   ```

---

### 11. **Scenario**: *You need to install a package on a Linux system, but the system doesn't have internet access. How would you install it?*

**Answer**:
1. **Download the package** on a machine with internet access.
2. **Transfer the package** to the target system (via USB or network).
3. **Install the package** using `dpkg` (for Debian/Ubuntu) or `rpm` (for CentOS/Red Hat):
   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i /path/to/package.deb   # Debian/Ubuntu
   sudo rpm -i /path/to/package.rpm    # RedHat/CentOS
   ```

---

### 12. **Scenario**: *How would you check if a service is running on your Linux server?*

**Answer**:
1. **Using `systemctl`** (for systemd-based systems):
   ```bash
   systemctl status service-name
   ```

2. **Using `ps`** (for older init-based systems):
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep service-name
   ```

---

### 13. **Scenario**: *How would you change the hostname of a Linux system?*

**Answer**:
1. **Edit `/etc/hostname`**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/hostname
   ```

2. **Update `/etc/hosts`**:
   Update the entry that matches your old hostname to the new one.

3. **Apply the changes**:
   ```bash
   sudo hostnamectl set-hostname newhostname
   ```

---

### 14. **Scenario**: *A user complains they are receiving "Permission Denied" errors when trying to access a directory. What would you check?*

**Answer**:
1. **Check the directory’s permissions**:
   ```bash
   ls -ld /path/to/directory
   ```

2. **Check if the user belongs to the appropriate group**:
   ```bash
   groups username
   ```

3. **Check ACLs**:
   ```bash
   getfacl /path/to/directory
   ```

---

### 15. **Scenario**: *You need to stop a process but don't know its process ID (PID). How would you find it?*

**Answer**:
1. **Use `ps` or `top` to find the PID**:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep process-name
   ```

2. **Alternatively, use `pgrep`**:
   ```bash
   pgrep process-name
   ```

3. **Stop the process using `kill`**:
   ```bash
   kill -9 <PID>
   ```

---

### 16. **Scenario**: *You need to schedule a one-time task to run at a specific time in the future. How would you do this?*

```

---

### 18. **Scenario**: *A file is too large to view using `cat` or `less`. How can you view it in chunks?*

**Answer**:
Use `split` to break the file into smaller chunks, or use `less` to scroll through it interactively:
