Here are **20 scenario-based Docker interview questions and answers** that can help you prepare for a Docker-focused interview:

---

### 1. **Scenario**: *You have a Docker container running a web application, but you need to see the logs of the container. How do you access the logs?*

**Answer**:
You can access the logs of a running container using the `docker logs` command:
```bash
docker logs <container_id or container_name>
```
For real-time logs, you can use:
```bash
docker logs -f <container_id or container_name>
```

---

### 2. **Scenario**: *You have multiple containers running on your system. How do you find the IP address of a specific container?*

**Answer**:
To find the IP address of a container, use:
```bash
docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' <container_id or container_name>
```

Alternatively, to list all containers' IP addresses, you can run:
```bash
docker ps -q | xargs -I {} docker inspect --format '{{.Name}} {{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}}' {}
```

---

### 3. **Scenario**: *You want to run a container in the background (detached mode) and map port 80 from the container to port 8080 on your host machine. How do you do that?*

**Answer**:
You can run the container in detached mode and map the ports as follows:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 <image_name>
```

- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
- `-p 8080:80`: Maps port 80 inside the container to port 8080 on the host.

---

### 4. **Scenario**: *You need to copy a file from your host machine to a running Docker container. How do you do this?*

**Answer**:
You can use the `docker cp` command:
```bash
docker cp /path/to/local/file <container_id or container_name>:/path/to/container/destination
```

This copies the file from the host to the container.

---

### 5. **Scenario**: *You want to run a container in interactive mode and access a shell inside the container. How do you do this?*

**Answer**:
Use the `-it` flags to run the container interactively:
```bash
docker run -it <image_name> /bin/bash
```
This starts the container and gives you access to the shell inside the container.

---

### 6. **Scenario**: *You want to stop and remove a container that is no longer needed. How do you do that?*

**Answer**:
To stop and remove a container:
```bash
docker stop <container_id or container_name>
docker rm <container_id or container_name>
```

If you want to stop and remove all containers at once, you can run:
```bash
docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)
```

---

### 7. **Scenario**: *You want to remove an image that is no longer used by any container. How can you do that?*

**Answer**:
To remove an image, use:
```bash
docker rmi <image_id or image_name>
```

If the image is being used by a container, you'll need to stop and remove the container first, or you can force-remove the image:
```bash
docker rmi -f <image_id or image_name>
```

---

### 8. **Scenario**: *You’ve built a Docker image, but you want to tag it with a different version number. How do you do that?*

**Answer**:
To tag an existing image with a new version, use:
```bash
docker tag <image_id or image_name> <new_image_name>:<new_version>
```

Example:
```bash
docker tag myapp:latest myapp:v2
```

---

### 9. **Scenario**: *You want to create a custom Docker image from an existing Dockerfile. How do you build the image?*

**Answer**:
Use the `docker build` command:
```bash
docker build -t <image_name>:<tag> /path/to/Dockerfile
```
For example:
```bash
docker build -t myapp:1.0 .
```
This will build an image named `myapp` with tag `1.0` from the Dockerfile located in the current directory (`.`).

---

### 10. **Scenario**: *You want to check the status of all running containers. How do you do that?*

**Answer**:
To list all running containers, use:
```bash
docker ps
```
If you want to see all containers (including stopped ones), use:
```bash
docker ps -a
```

---

### 11. **Scenario**: *You have made changes to a container’s file system and you want to create a new image from that container. How can you do this?*

**Answer**:
You can commit the container’s changes to a new image:
```bash
docker commit <container_id or container_name> <new_image_name>:<tag>
```
For example:
```bash
docker commit my_container myapp:v1
```

---

### 12. **Scenario**: *You want to run a container and mount a directory from your host machine into the container. How do you do that?*

**Answer**:
Use the `-v` option to mount a directory from the host into the container:
```bash
docker run -v /path/to/host/directory:/path/to/container/directory <image_name>
```

For example:
```bash
docker run -v /home/user/data:/data myapp
```

---

### 13. **Scenario**: *You want to scale a Docker service running with Docker Swarm. How do you scale it up?*

**Answer**:
You can scale the number of replicas of a service in Docker Swarm using the `docker service scale` command:
```bash
docker service scale <service_name>=<replica_count>
```
For example:
```bash
docker service scale myservice=5
```

This will scale the `myservice` to 5 replicas.

---

### 14. **Scenario**: *You want to run a Docker container with environment variables. How can you set them?*

**Answer**:
You can set environment variables using the `-e` flag:
```bash
docker run -e ENV_VAR_NAME=value <image_name>
```

For example:
```bash
docker run -e DB_HOST=localhost -e DB_PORT=3306 myapp
```

---

### 15. **Scenario**: *You want to ensure that a container automatically restarts if it crashes. How do you configure that?*

**Answer**:
Use the `--restart` flag when running the container:
```bash
docker run --restart unless-stopped <image_name>
```
Other restart policies include:
- `no`: No automatic restart (default).
- `always`: Always restart the container if it stops.
- `on-failure`: Restart only if the container exits with a non-zero status.

---

### 16. **Scenario**: *You want to see the resource usage (CPU, memory) of a running container. How can you check this?*

**Answer**:
You can use the `docker stats` command to view the resource usage of running containers:
```bash
docker stats
```
This will show CPU, memory, and other resource usage for all running containers.

---

### 17. **Scenario**: *You need to limit the CPU and memory usage of a container. How do you do this?*

**Answer**:
Use the `--memory` and `--cpus` flags when running the container:
```bash
docker run --memory=500m --cpus=1.5 <image_name>
```
This limits the container to 500 MB of memory and 1.5 CPUs.

---

### 18. **Scenario**: *You need to build a Docker image from a Dockerfile, but the build process should ignore certain files and directories. How can you do this?*

**Answer**:
Use a `.dockerignore` file to specify files and directories to ignore during the build process. For example:
```
node_modules
*.log
test/
```
The `.dockerignore` file works similarly to a `.gitignore` file.

---

### 19. **Scenario**: *You want to run a container with a different user instead of the default root user. How do you do that?*

**Answer**:
Use the `--user` flag when running the container:
```bash
docker run --user <user_id>:<group_id> <image_name>
```
For example, to run the container as user `1001` and group `1001`:
```bash
docker run --user 1001:1001 myapp
```

---

### 20. **Scenario**: *You need to expose multiple ports from a container to the host. How would you map multiple ports?*

**Answer**:
You can expose multiple ports by using the `-p` flag multiple times:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 -p 3306:3306 <image_name>
```
This maps port 80 inside the container to port 8080 on the host, and port 3306 inside the container to port 3306 on the host.
